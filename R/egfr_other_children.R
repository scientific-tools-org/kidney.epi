# FUNCTION: BEGIN
#' @details Calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Schwartz equation.

#' @author Programming: Boris Bikbov https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-bikbov.
#' @param creatinine Numeric vector. Serum creatinine, could be expressed in "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL". Units of measurement should be defined in variable creatinine_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "micromol/L").
#' @param age Numeric vector. Age, in years. Age does not accounted in Schwartz equation, but used in the function to check whether Schwartz equation could be applied to a given patient.
#' @param sex Vector. The value of variable refers to the parameters label_sex_male and label_sex_female. Required only in case of quadratic Schwartz equation. 
#' @param height_cm Numeric vector. Could be defined either as height_cm if is measured in cm, or as height_ft and height_inch if is measured in feet and inches.
#'    If the parameter height_cm is greater than 0, the function uses cm, otherwise - feet and inches.
#' @param height_ft see height_cm
#' @param height_inch see height_cm
#' @param creatinine_units Character string. Units in which serum creatinne is expressed. Could be one of the following: "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL".
#' @param equation_type Character string. Define whether to calculate eGFR either by classic Schwartz or quadratic Schwartz equation. Could be one of the following: "classic", "quadratic". If not explicitly defined by user, the default assumption is "classic".
#' @param label_sex_male List. Label(s) for definition(s) of male sex.
#' @param label_sex_female List. Label(s) for definition(s) of female sex.
#' @return numeric eGFR expressed in ml/min/1.73m\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}.
