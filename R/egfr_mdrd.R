#' @param creatinine Numeric vector. Serum creatinine, could be expressed in "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL". Units of measurement should be defined in variable creatinine_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "micromol/L").
#' @param age Numeric vector. Age, in years.
#' @param sex Vector. The value of variable refers to the parameters label_sex_male and label_sex_female.
#' @param ethnicity Vector. Ethnicity, specify in case of African-American patients. The value of variable refers to the parameter label_afroamerican.
#' @param creatinine_units Character string. Units in which serum creatinne is expressed. Could be one of the following: "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL".
#' @param creatinine_method Character string. Creatinine standartisation method in a laboratory. Could be either "IDMS" or "non-IDMS". If not explicitly defined by user, the default assumption is "non-IDMS".
#' @param label_afroamerican List. Label(s) for Afroamerican ethnicity.
#' @param label_sex_male List. Label(s) for definition(s) of male sex.
#' @param label_sex_female List. Label(s) for definition(s) of female sex.
#' @param max_age Numeric. Maximal age suitable for the equation application, in years. By default is 100 years, but change this value in case you would like to apply equation to older persons.
#' @return numeric eGFR expressed in ml/min/1.73m\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}.

    #  for example:
    #    if males in your data file defined as "Male", you have to change below the variable label_sex_male = "Male";
    #    if you use 1 for definition of male sex, you have to change below the variable label_sex_male = 1;
    #    if males in your data file defined either as "Male" or as "MALE" or as "Males" or as "M", you have to change below the variable label_sex_male = c ("Male", "MALE", "Males", "M"), but in this case it is worth to normalize your data dictionary;
