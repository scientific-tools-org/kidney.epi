\usage{
egfr.schwartz(
  creatinine,
  age,
  sex,
  height_cm = 0,
  height_ft = 0,
  height_inch = 0,
  creatinine_units = "micromol/l",
  equation_type = "classic",
  label_sex_male = c("Male", 1),
  label_sex_female = c("Female", 0)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{creatinine}{Numeric vector. Serum creatinine, could be expressed in "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL". Units of measurement should be defined in variable creatinine_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "micromol/L").}

\item{age}{Numeric vector. Age, in years. Age does not accounted in Schwartz equation, but used in the function to check whether Schwartz equation could be applied to a given patient.}

\item{sex}{Vector. The value of variable refers to the parameters label_sex_male and label_sex_female. Required only in case of quadratic Schwartz equation.}

\item{height_cm}{Numeric vector. Could be defined either as height_cm if is measured in cm, or as height_ft and height_inch if is measured in feet and inches.
If the parameter height_cm is greater than 0, the function uses cm, otherwise - feet and inches.}

\item{height_ft}{see height_cm}

\item{height_inch}{see height_cm}

\item{creatinine_units}{Character string. Units in which serum creatinne is expressed. Could be one of the following: "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL".}

\item{equation_type}{Character string. Define whether to calculate eGFR either by classic Schwartz or quadratic Schwartz equation. Could be one of the following: "classic", "quadratic". If not explicitly defined by user, the default assumption is "classic".}

\item{label_sex_male}{List. Label(s) for definition(s) of male sex.}

\item{label_sex_female}{List. Label(s) for definition(s) of female sex.}
