\title{Calculate eGFR by the Full age spectrum (FAS) cystatin-based equation}
\usage{
egfr.fas.cys(
  cystatin,
  age,
  cystatin_units = "mg/L",
  equation_type = "precise",
  max_age = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cystatin}{Numeric vector. Serum cystatin, could be expressed in "mg/L" or "nanomol/L". Units of measurement should be defined in variable cystatin_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "mg/L").}

\item{age}{Numeric vector. Age, in years.}

\item{cystatin_units}{Character string. Units in which serum cystatin is expressed. Could be one of the following: "mg/L" or "nanomol/L"}

\item{equation_type}{Character string. Whether to use "precise" or "simplified" equation.}

\item{max_age}{Numeric. Maximal age suitable for the equation application, in years. By default is 100 years, but change this value in case you would like to apply equation to older persons.}
}
\value{
numeric eGFR expressed in ml/min/1.73m\ifelse{html}{\out{<sup>2</sup>}}{\eqn{^2}}.
