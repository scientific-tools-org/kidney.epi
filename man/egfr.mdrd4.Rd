\title{Calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by MDRD equation}
\usage{
egfr.mdrd4(
  creatinine,
  age,
  sex,
  ethnicity,
  creatinine_units = "micromol/l",
  creatinine_method = "non-IDMS",
  label_afroamerican = c("Afroamerican"),
  label_sex_male = c("Male", 1),
  label_sex_female = c("Female", 0),
  max_age = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{creatinine}{Numeric vector. Serum creatinine, could be expressed in "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL". Units of measurement should be defined in variable creatinine_units (if not defined explicitly by user, the default value is "micromol/L").}

\item{age}{Numeric vector. Age, in years.}

\item{sex}{Vector. The value of variable refers to the parameters label_sex_male and label_sex_female.}

\item{ethnicity}{Vector. Ethnicity, specify in case of African-American patients. The value of variable refers to the parameter label_afroamerican.}

\item{creatinine_units}{Character string. Units in which serum creatinne is expressed. Could be one of the following: "micromol/L", "mmol/L" or "mg/dL".}

\item{creatinine_method}{Character string. Creatinine standartisation method in a laboratory. Could be either "IDMS" or "non-IDMS". If not explicitly defined by user, the default assumption is "non-IDMS".}

\item{label_afroamerican}{List. Label(s) for Afroamerican ethnicity.}

\item{label_sex_male}{List. Label(s) for definition(s) of male sex.}

\item{label_sex_female}{List. Label(s) for definition(s) of female sex.}

\item{max_age}{Numeric. Maximal age suitable for the equation application, in years. By default is 100 years, but change this value in case you would like to apply equation to older persons.}
