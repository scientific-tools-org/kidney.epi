Possibility use different measurement units creatinine: need decode creatinine values data set. Just define ‘creatinine_units’ parameter whether data contain values micromol/L, mmol/L mg/dL - rest processed function. data frame label “Male” males, can skip definition already assumed function, define clarity label_sex_male = “Male”. Consider labels case-sensitive, thus attentive “Male” “male” similar definitions. data frame uses different labeling conventions, can easily adjust labels function parameters align data. example, data frame contains labels “F” females “M” males, indicate labeling parameters function label_sex_male = “M”, label_sex_female = “F”. functions support also multiple labels non-standard mixed data. ’re working data hasn’t fully standardized — category might different labels — function allows define multiple values valid labels category. example, male sex represented “male” “hombre” labels female sex “female” “mujer” labels, can define: label_sex_male = c(“male”, “hombre”), label_sex_female = c(“female”, “mujer”). male sex represented “male” 1, can define: label_sex_male = c(“male”, 1). male sex represented “male” “Male” (case-sensitive), can define: label_sex_male = c(“male”, “Male”). result, need modify original dataset — just adjust function parameters instead. saves time reduces data preprocessing efforts, well improve code readability.","code":""},{"path":"https://scientific-tools.org/portfolio-item/r-open-source-kidney-epi-package/articles/gfr.html","id":"references","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculation","what":"References","title":"Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculation","text":"References eGFR equation listed documentation package.","code":""},{"path":"https://scientific-tools.org/portfolio-item/r-open-source-kidney-epi-package/articles/ktx.html","id":"kidney-transplantation","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Kidney transplantation","title":"Kidney transplantation","text":"kidney.epi R package includes functions useful kidney transplantation, sample data frame.
